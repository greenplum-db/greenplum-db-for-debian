# Greenplum DB for Debian

## Overview

Packaging of Greenplum Database for Debian and Debian-derived Linux
distributions. Contains configuration and metadata needed for existing OSS
tooling to build binary installers from source in compliance with the technical
and licensing requirements of the Debian archive.

The major goals of this project are:

1. Produce packages of Greenplum Database in compliance with the technical and
   licensing requirements of the Debian project
2. Make it easier for OSS users to install and run Greenplum Database

Based on these two goals, this project will follow the Debian project as much
as possible but ultimately defer to the existing OSS Greenplum Database
projectâ€™s model.
